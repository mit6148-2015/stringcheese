a project on displaying trending instagram hashtags

##Current Functons:
1. Display map with top hashtags when hovering (in order for the hashtags to work, you need to refresh the page -- need to fix this)
2. When clicking on a country on the map or searching for a country it goes to a page that displays that countries photos from instagram that are tagged with the top hashtag.  The country displays correctly but the hashtag is currently hardcoded so we need to fix this by getting the correct hashtag from the database.
3. Login works.

###Future Functions:
1. Update the users database so that it contains the countries they have added to their selected countries (and make the Selected Page).
2. Make it pretty.
3. Do the local page - get the location of the user and display the photos with the top hashtag from their area.
4. Have the world page display all of the top hashtag photos from all around the world.
